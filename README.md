# Panel Data

In computing, **row-major order** and **column-major order** are methods for storing multidimensional arrays in linear storage such as random access memory (RAM). [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order)

The difference between the orders lies in which elements of an array are [contiguous](#memory-contiguity) in memory. <br>
In row-major order, the consecutive elements of a row reside next to each other, whereas the same holds true for consecutive elements of a column in column-major order.

To better illustrate this, take a glance below:

## Memory Contiguity
According to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contiguous), contiguous means:

> being in actual contact / touching or connected throughout in an **unbroken** sequence
